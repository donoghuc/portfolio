## Personal Information
The prjects in this section were built to increase my web presense as I transition from finishing my CS degree/Internship to industry. 
I will shamelessly include a link to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/casadilla) profile here! 

### [casadilla_web](https://github.com/donoghuc/casadilla_web)
I am maintaining a personal website built in python :snake: to learn more about full stack engineering, web basics and dev ops. I am hosting the project on Digital Ocean https://www.cas-donoghue.org, It is currently under active development but my studies :mortar_board: are taking priority for now! 

### [donoghuc.github.io](https://github.com/donoghuc/donoghuc.github.io)
I am using github.io to host my resume. Please check it out at https://donoghuc.github.io or refer to someone who may be hiring! :wink: 

### [cd_reference](https://github.com/donoghuc/cd_reference)
This repository is full of README files organized into directories that I store personal reminders when I find myself working/studying. There are code examples, bash commands, git reference etc. 

## Collaboration
This section has projects meant to address specific topics with community members. :bar_chart:

### [data_discussions_r_python](https://github.com/donoghuc/data_discussions_r_py)
I am member of the [PDX Data Science Meetup] (https://www.meetup.com/Portland-Data-Science-Group/). This repo is part of a discussion about collaboration between data scientists. We detail working together in R and Python using Jupyter Notebooks and Git(hub). 

### [bokeh_recipe](https://github.com/donoghuc/bokeh_recipe)
This repository shows examples for a problem I posted on [Stack Overflow] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47578746/how-to-configure-nginx-with-gunicorn-and-bokeh-serve)
