# Cas Donoghue Portfolio
The purpose of this repository is to provide brief project descriptions in a central location. Detailed project information can be found in each project's README(s). 

__What is missing?__ Well over the past year the majority of the code that I have written has been for industry (pharmaceutical and tech). I am obviously not allowed publicly show off those projects! 

Thanks for looking! :eyes:

## Personal Information
The prjects in this section were built to increase my web presense as I transition from finishing my CS degree/Internship to industry. 
I will shamelessly include a link to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/casadilla) profile here! 

### [casadilla_web](https://github.com/donoghuc/casadilla_web)
I am maintaining a personal website built in python :snake: to learn more about full stack engineering, web basics and dev ops. I am hosting the project on Digital Ocean https://www.cas-donoghue.org, It is currently under active development but my studies :mortar_board: are taking priority for now! 

### [donoghuc.github.io](https://github.com/donoghuc/donoghuc.github.io)
I am using github.io to host my resume. Please check it out at https://donoghuc.github.io or refer to someone who may be hiring! :wink: 

### [cd_reference](https://github.com/donoghuc/cd_reference)
This repository is full of README files organized into directories that I store personal reminders when I find myself working/studying. There are code examples, bash commands, git reference etc. 

## Collaboration
This section has projects meant to address specific topics with community members. :bar_chart:

### [data_discussions_r_python](https://github.com/donoghuc/data_discussions_r_py)
I am member of the [PDX Data Science Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Portland-Data-Science-Group/). This repo is part of a discussion about collaboration between data scientists. We detail working together in R and Python using Jupyter Notebooks and Git(hub). 

### [bokeh_recipe](https://github.com/donoghuc/bokeh_recipe)
This repository shows examples for a problem I posted on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47578746/how-to-configure-nginx-with-gunicorn-and-bokeh-serve). I am still working on a solution but I have to change some things as the base docker images were built using proprietary Oracle Linux (I am no longer an intern at Oracle and have lost access to those). 

### [public_html](https://github.com/donoghuc/public_html)
I am currently enrolled in a class at OSU called Defense Against the Dark Arts. I will be maintaining a weekly blog post that is hosted at http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~donoghuc (thanks for the public domain OSU!)  

## Code Samples
This section has some code samples of a diverse range of project I have worked on. I think they represent some of my growth as a developer over my acedemic and professional career. MORE TO COME! :rocket:

### [technical_assessment_code_example](https://github.com/donoghuc/technical_assessment_code_example)
As part of an application process I was asked to perform a technical challenge (SQL based data analysis). I have left out details of the company but want to show my effort on the project publicly. 

### [code_example_1](https://github.com/donoghuc/code_example_1)
This is a school project that uses both C and Python to work together in a simple chat application. I think it demonstrates my knowledge of networking as well as C and Python fundamentals (though I consider myself a MUCH better python programmer a year later...). 

### [code_example_2](https://github.com/donoghuc/code_example_2)
A similar project to code example 1 (same class) that uses Python and C to implement a simple FTP server. 

### School Projects
I dont really expect reviewer to get much from these projects, They are class projects that I have worked on over the years! :computer:

### [CS362-004-W2018](https://github.com/donoghuc/CS362-004-W2018)
Software Engineering II (currently enrolled) repo

### [group_4_CS351](https://github.com/donoghuc/group_4_CS361)
Flask application for prototyping registration software for use in emergency aid. 

### [tspChristofides](https://github.com/donoghuc/tspChristofides)
Analysis of Algorithms class challenge to solve TSP the "best" (fastest/most accurate). 

### [Project2_group31](https://github.com/donoghuc/Project2_group31)
Analysis of algorithms assignment for differnet optimization algorithms. 

### [Project1_group31](https://github.com/donoghuc/Project1_group31)
Analysis of algorithms assignment for MSS implementation. 

### [finalProject](https://github.com/donoghuc/finalProject)
Hillariously bad node.js web app! Love looking back...

### [BreweryDBapi](https://github.com/donoghuc/BreweryDBapi)
Reference for brewery DB (horribly out of date now i'm sure) :beer:

### [seqGen](https://github.com/donoghuc/seqGen)
Here we have one of the first things I ever coded! It is a C++ application I used in nucleic acid research back in my very early molecular biology days.
