# Cas Donoghue Portfolio
The purpose of this repository is to provide brief project descriptions in a central location. Detailed project information can be found in each project's README(s). 

__What is missing?__ Well over the past year the majority of the code that I have written has been for industry (pharmaceutical and tech). I am obviously not allowed publicly show off those projects! 

Thanks for looking! :eyes:

## Personal Information
The projects in this section were built to increase my web presense as I transition from finishing my CS degree/Internship to industry. 
I will shamelessly include a link to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/casadilla) profile here! 

### [casadilla_web](https://github.com/donoghuc/casadilla_web)
I am maintaining a personal website built in python :snake: to learn more about full stack engineering, web basics and dev ops. I am hosting the project on Digital Ocean https://www.cas-donoghue.org, It is currently under active development but my studies :mortar_board: are taking priority for now! 

### [donoghuc.github.io](https://github.com/donoghuc/donoghuc.github.io)
I am using github.io to host my resume. Please check it out at https://donoghuc.github.io or refer to someone who may be hiring! :wink: 

### [cd_reference](https://github.com/donoghuc/cd_reference)
This repository is full of README files organized into directories that I store personal reminders when I find myself working/studying. There are code examples, bash commands, git reference etc. 

## Collaboration
This section has projects meant to address specific topics with community members. :bar_chart:

### [visual_web_crawler](https://github.com/donoghuc/visual_web_crawler)
The Caelum group will be implementing a graphical web crawler. The idea is to build a web interface that allows the user to seed the crawler with a website URL they are interested in. Our back end server will start at this web location and begin crawling in either a breadth first of depth first traversal of all links discovered starting from the seed link. Information about the exploration will be logged and used to build an interactive visualization which will be presented to the user for inspection. The name group name Caelum is fitting for this project as our visualization will be reminiscent of a constellation where nodes representing visited sites are the stars! https://www.caelum.site/

### [data_discussions_r_python](https://github.com/donoghuc/data_discussions_r_py)
I am member of the [PDX Data Science Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Portland-Data-Science-Group/). This repo is part of a discussion about collaboration between data scientists. We detail working together in R and Python using Jupyter Notebooks and Git(hub). 

### [bokeh_recipe](https://github.com/donoghuc/bokeh_recipe)
This repository shows examples for a problem I posted on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47578746/how-to-configure-nginx-with-gunicorn-and-bokeh-serve). I am still working on a solution but I have to change some things as the base docker images were built using proprietary Oracle Linux (I am no longer an intern at Oracle and have lost access to those). 

### [public_html](https://github.com/donoghuc/public_html)
I am currently enrolled in a class at OSU called Defense Against the Dark Arts. I will be maintaining a weekly blog post that is hosted at http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~donoghuc (thanks for the public domain OSU!)  

### [python_ocr](https://github.com/donoghuc/python_ocr)
As described in public_html I am in a survey course at OSU about modern computer security topics. We do quite a bit of work on quarantined VMs. These VMs are configured such that there is no copy-paste functionality between local and remove machines. There are often times I would like to search for hashes/checksums or certain strings found in malware source code. I am using python and Optical Character Recognition with tesseract-ocr and openCV so I can take a screen shot of text on the VM then convert it to text. 

## Code Samples
This section has some code samples of a diverse range of project I have worked on. I think they represent some of my growth as a developer over my acedemic and professional career. MORE TO COME! :rocket:

### [technical_assessment_code_example](https://github.com/donoghuc/technical_assessment_code_example)
As part of an application process I was asked to perform a technical challenge (SQL based data analysis). I have left out details of the company but want to show my effort on the project publicly. 

### [code_example_1](https://github.com/donoghuc/code_example_1)
This is a school project that uses both C and Python to work together in a simple chat application. I think it demonstrates my knowledge of networking as well as C and Python fundamentals (though I consider myself a MUCH better python programmer a year later...). 

### [code_example_2](https://github.com/donoghuc/code_example_2)
A similar project to code example 1 (same class) that uses Python and C to implement a simple FTP server. 

### School Projects
I dont really expect reviewer to get much from these projects, They are class projects that I have worked on over the years! :computer:

### [windows_psutil](https://github.com/donoghuc/windows_psutil)
This is an assignment submission for the modern software security survey class. Quite a bit of the course work examines windows OS specific exploits. This assignment (as described in repository) is designed to investigate the windows API using a programming language of choice. 

### [CS362-004-W2018](https://github.com/donoghuc/CS362-004-W2018)
Software Engineering II (currently enrolled) repo

### [group_4_CS351](https://github.com/donoghuc/group_4_CS361)
Flask application for prototyping registration software for use in emergency aid. 

### [tspChristofides](https://github.com/donoghuc/tspChristofides)
Analysis of Algorithms class challenge to solve TSP the "best" (fastest/most accurate). 

### [Project2_group31](https://github.com/donoghuc/Project2_group31)
Analysis of algorithms assignment for differnet optimization algorithms. 

### [Project1_group31](https://github.com/donoghuc/Project1_group31)
Analysis of algorithms assignment for MSS implementation. 

### [finalProject](https://github.com/donoghuc/finalProject)
Hillariously bad node.js web app! Love looking back...

### [BreweryDBapi](https://github.com/donoghuc/BreweryDBapi)
Reference for brewery DB (horribly out of date now i'm sure) :beer:

### [seqGen](https://github.com/donoghuc/seqGen)
Here we have one of the first things I ever coded! It is a C++ application I used in nucleic acid research back in my very early molecular biology days.
